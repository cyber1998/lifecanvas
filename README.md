Journals are not just personal diaries, but they can contain ideas, memories, rich experiences and sometimes, confessions. They can either be very personal, or they can be a strong second voice of a person that might change millions of lives.

Lifecanvas is an attempt at evolving the way users write journals, so that the modern age of technology can help preserve these rich experiences in a safe, trusted environment while allowing the person to use rich tools to improve their journaling experience.
